##Region name : Subcontinent West

##To Run the Code
\indent Create a directory called "data" in this project folder \par
\indent Download the data text files from the URL we will be provided below. Save the data in the "data" directory" \par
\indent Open and run "data_cleaning.Rmd", all the cleaned data will be stored in an automatically created directory called "Cleaned_Data" \par
\indent Open and run "EDA and Writeup.Rmd", here stores all the codes for EDA analysis and our discussions about the data. \par


#Summary and EDA of reported data.

##The Condition of the Data and Interesting Detail 

\indent Without considering the location, lowest temperature is usually between December and January, while the highest temperatures around August. According to the geography, subcontinent west is close to equator so the temperature difference through the year should not be noticeable.  Since water has bigger specific heat capacity, from the equation $\Delta$T=Q/mc ($\Delta$=temperature change, Q=heat, m=mass, c=specific heat capacity), we can predict that the sea temperature change has a smaller range than that of air temperature, which is consistence with our plots.  Also, in our plots, there’s no pattern showing increase or decrease of temperature from 2001 to 2016.\par



##The Data Acquisition and Density of Data.

\indent For our analysis purpose, ship data is used instead of buoy data, since buoy data only contains the measurement of water depth. Ship data is dependent on the fact that ships needed to be passing through our assigned area. Data from VOS website is divided per month from 2001 to 2016. we make sure the range is in sub-continent west by limit the range of latitude from 6 to 20 and longitude from 60 to 80. In order to make data fit into preferred region while remaining consistent through years, we measure our data within a 6-hour range of noon. We dropped all the data with "NA" value in order to keep our data logically and easy for analysis. By dropping extreme measurement that out of range between (0.01,0.99), we kept the consistency of our data.\par

#Maps

\indent We created maps per year which show the data of Sub-Continent West region from 2001 to 2016. As we can see, when times goes on, records showing that there are more and more ship lanes are travel through this area and more data is collected in Sub-Continent West.

#Discussion

\indent In subcontinent west, the average sea temperature has raised significantly from 2001 (around 10 degrees) to 2016 (around 27 degrees). The biggest change occurs during the period of 2001 – 2003 and after 2003 the average sea temperatures are mainly around 25 degrees. \par
\indent Therefore, we expect that there could be some significant climate change or human-caused change happened during that period. \par

\indent There is not so much difference between average air temperatures from 2001 to 2016 (mainly around 28 degrees). Clearly, the difference between average sea and air temperature has decreased a lot from 2001, 18 degrees’ difference to 2016, approximately no difference. \par
\indent Therefore, further investigation can be done to find out the main reason for the increase in sea temperature.

\indent To further confirm our previous findings, we plot the average air and sea temperature for the same month (January and August) across 16 years.  The overall trend of average sea temperature is the same across those 16 years with a sharp increase in the first five years and then remain almost the same in the next ten years. On the other hand, the trends of average air temperature are different for the January and August. The sharp increase in the air temperature occurs in 2002 of January but in 2003, 2006, 2008 and 2014 of August.
