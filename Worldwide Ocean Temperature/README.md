This is the directory for MA415 project 2 "Worldwide Ocean Temperature"

To Run the Code
Create a directory called "data" in this project folder 
Download the data text files from the URL we will be provided in the report. Save the data in the "data" directory. In this repo, I have already included the data, so no need for further downloading.
Open and run "data_cleaning.Rmd", all the cleaned data will be stored in an automatically created directory called "Cleaned_Data" 
Open and run "Report and EDA.Rmd", here stores all the codes for EDA analysis and our discussions about the data.
